## Idea Explanation

We plan to create a forest representation that our user can walk through. However, instead of creating your traditional forest, we plan to be a bit creative by making an "after apocolypse forest." In other words, we'll have some burnt, brown, and broken down trees instead of having all our world all beautiful, fully grown, and green. This idea will give a creative twist to the traditional design in addition to an exciting and thrilling walk through to the user.

As the user moves through the terrain, new world objects will appear within various constraints that we will implement. The constraints are still to be decided, but they will make the objects fall in a certain area, be a certain size, and facing a specific direction. For example, if we generate a path, we have to make sure the path follows a direction and the trees will have to be generated outside of the path.

Our plan is to go through the project in milestones. The following section breaks down the milestones we will be going to do. In each milestone, we'll split the task equally among the four of us. The milestones are still needded to be broken down to the task that we will be assigning to each other, however, when this is done, we'll be creating issues for each task to keep track of what needs to be done and what is done.

##Milestones
- Generate a terrain `week #6`
- explore terrain - camera explore `week #7`
- generate trees `week #8`
- manipulate trees `week #9`
- exploration with trees `week #11`
- collision handling `week #13`
