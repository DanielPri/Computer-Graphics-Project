## Idea Explanation

We plan to create a forest representation that our user can walk through. However, instead of creating your traditional forest, we plan to be a bit creative by making an "after apocolypse forest." In other words, we'll have some burnt, brown, and broken down trees instead of having all our world all beautiful, fully grown, and green. This idea will give a creative twist to the traditional design in addition to an exciting and thrilling walk through to the user.

As the user moves through the terrain, new world objects will appear within various constraints that we will implement. The constraints are still to be decided, but they will make the objects fall in a certain area, be a certain size, and facing a specific direction. For example, if we generate a path, we have to make sure the path follows a direction and the trees will have to be generated outside of the path.

##Milestones
- Generate a terrain `week #6`
- explore terrain - camera explore `week #7`
- generate trees `week #8`
- manipulate trees `week #9`
- exploration with trees `week #11`
- collision handling `week #13`
